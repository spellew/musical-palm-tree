I don't think I learned anything new while working on this project, due to my prior experience with HTML and CSS. This project was a nice refresher though, I was reminded of a few things. The easiest part was matching what I saw in the mock up PDF to the elements I already knew, and adding those elements to the HTML document. The difficult part was describing unknown elements, so I could look them up and add them to the HTML document. I used the problem solving strategies from the first project to help me find the unknown elements.
